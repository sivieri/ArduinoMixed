SkypeTransformer

SkypeTransformer takes the output of Skype Log Viewer [1],
in XML format, and outputs an HTML file representing all
the conversations in the correct order.

The Saxon .NET XSL 2.0 library is licensed under the
Mozilla Public License, and the "Home Edition" 9.3 is
redistributed along the SkypeTransform application.
